<h2>Git</h2>
What is it used for? = Git is primarily used for version control. So instead of having to manage all previous versions manually, Git is a saftware that will do all of that for you. Collaboration is also a big part of Git, it is used to have multiple users invested in the same project file. 
<h2>GitHub</h2>
Unlike Git, GitHUB is a online service, something that cannot be fully downloaded as a software but as a part of a website. BUT, it still uses Git behind the scenes. 
<h2>Repo</h2>
A Repo (Repository) is another word for "Project" Which has a collection of files. 
<h2>Commit</h2>
Hmm. So I want to edit something or create a new file, I make a new file and add some text. But where's the save button? The commit button is basically the same thing as a save button in this case, where I want to commit to these changes.
